The Pentagon is the worlds largest office builduing, six and a half milion square feet, 30,000 people more than 17 miles of corridors but it was built with
just 3 street doors each opening into a guarded pedestrian lobby. I chose the southest option the main concourse entrance the one nearest the metro and the bus station
because it was the busiest and the most popular with civilian workers and I wanted plenty of civilian workers around. For insurance purposes mostly against getting shot on sight.
Arrests go bad all the time sometimes accidentally, sometimes on purpose so I wanted witnesses I remember the date off course. It was Tuesday, March 11 1997. It was the last day I walked
into that place as a legal employee of the people who built it.
